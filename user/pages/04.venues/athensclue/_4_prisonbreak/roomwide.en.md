Two reviews for this one. First: Amazingly original! Not all players start with the same role, access to the same areas, or.. abilities. Much more of a storyline than anything else in Athens Clue. Mechanics and interaction in some points are brilliant. One of the truest endings.A pure prison escape.End of this review.

Second: Whatever. Riddles that are not even close to logic. You work around a mentality "if i can extract any number out of this, I can open a lock".They told us that this has less searchins and more thought than the rest. True, usually it works with 90% searching and here it was 70%. It should not be like this.
The riddles are the worst I've encountered and hope it stays that way. Athens clue got me used to plain and simple riddles, an attempt to get more serious took a nice room and drowned it.

Personally, I want puzzles first and theme second. Their other rooms had a nice second, no first. This one managed to take the first to a negative.

Do as you will. Are you just for theme and riddles aren't for you? Go. Are you dissapointed by how easy other rooms are? Don't come close. Me and my friends mourned for our cash.
I suggest more than 3 people.

Should I try to make an average? it is 5 and 0, but adding the gravity of each it comes up.. hmm, 0.78.
1 small grey one (I feel generous, rounding up)
