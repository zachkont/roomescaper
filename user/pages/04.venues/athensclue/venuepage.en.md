One of the first (maybe the first?) of its kind in Athens.
Fully franchised, with three locations, Syntagma square, Hilton area and Glyfada. Many rooms (5+5+2), of which I have visited 4, that I can talk about. Clearly the one with the highest amount of searching. Based around hiding keys in the room, rather than creating riddles. To find where they hide they you might even need a magnifing glass or a metal detector..
Decent work around the mood and the quality of their rooms.
I'd characterise it as basic, since it does not do much to introduce anything new or unique.
