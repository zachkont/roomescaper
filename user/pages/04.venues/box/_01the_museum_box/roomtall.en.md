A very fun robbery.You get a strong feeling of a target, which adds to the experience
the Golden Brick!! Props, purposefull items and riddles with
typical difficulty and a refreshing originality. The museum is interactive and you will se that it does not let you get bored.
Looks could be better, if you really enjoy a believable space.
Very good for newbies, not very tough, for any number of people.

4 golden puzzle pieces, it was enjoyable (and they fit the Lego).
