A small trip in time, just for an hour, for the sake of fun. Time Box is for a start on a different location than the rest of The Box, probably because of time disturbances.

The game begins thematically, so be ready. The whole storypath, your goal and how you accomplish it is beautiful, making it a very enjoyable game.
In appearence, some parts are typical others top quality. Maybe a few too many props –one crazy cute one, please be carefull with some things you find-
it could benefit from removing some. There are parts that deserve an award.

In the riddles part, the room was not really my style. There were points that you are not lead into a solution, you just have to be very very observative and be creative. My belief is that most will need hints for those and I find
it dissapointing when you just wait for the hint, but again, my thing.
Αs a whole it is a very enjoyable room, just not flawless. Visit it please, just do not feel guilty for getting hints.
(it probably only bothers me). For every kind of player, and the higher the diversity of experience, the better.{c:red} Not for claustrophobics. There is a part of the game that they cannot be part of. You can contact them for info.{/c}

4? puzzle pieces.. Maybe, it wasn't my style with the needed hints, although it would be a shame to give it any less
