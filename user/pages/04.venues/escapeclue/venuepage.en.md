With a name that -not randomly- resembles that of Athens clue, EscapeClue Athens bases most of its game to you finding clues all around the room.
3 franchised rooms with an unintresting work on design and aesthetics compared to other escape room in the city.
Huge number of locks and very few puzzles that will be memorable.
