Their second room challenges you to escape with your prisoner-friend.
Obviously a medievil theme in the story.

Not in the room tho. The higher the target, the bigger the failure looks when it happens. Many of the few furniture are clearly modern, props are scarce and cheap
while specific points in the room break even the low bar it set itself.

Same pattern as the other one, even more locks,which you have to check one by one every time you find a code, which makes me doubt that it is tolerable with fewer than 5.
Any attempt for order would help. Still almost no parts that look like puzzles and not just collecting items. I believe 3 moments are of any intrest, 4 if I add one that looks so out of place
that they might as well put a blender in that "dungeon".
