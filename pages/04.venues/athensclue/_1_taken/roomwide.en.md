I'll admit that this was my start point. First successfull escape (first record) from a simple but unexpectedly enjoyable adventure.
Withought saying that there is any difficulty at al to finishing this room, you'll enjoy doing it. Simple riddles, simple searching, simple fun.

On the other hand though, if it is not your first, it is TOO simple. You will find absolutely nothing intresting, so this was played very safely, being one of the first rooms in Athens.

Nice for a first attempt, it can help getting into the game. For experienced player probably a walk in the park, take lots of newbies ;) 2 puzzles for the child's room
