Maybe the most cloned room in the genre. You'll find it in many places with. Unjustified? No,it's a classic, with books, notes and a magnifying glass, it's just the Sherlock hat that is missing. Honestly though, it was the only room I completely forgot about.
 I don't know why, its riddles, while not dumb, almost each one had something that spoiled them. I can blame it on my mood though, that might be it.
 Many things one could like in John's office, it has some creativity here and there. Decent for newbies and multi-time escapees (I hope it sounded ok)
