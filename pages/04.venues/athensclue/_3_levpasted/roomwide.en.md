The room of a scientist that wasn't that smart.

 My main question after the lab, was :"Did we actually solve anything?". I do not think it was a complete failure though. It has a mood of a lab, some items are beautifully crafted (not all) and had material to make it a great room (it wasn't).
 A no-go for newbies, they wouldn't know how and where to search and would lose a lot of time dissapointed.
 Way too much searching around, the only thing that will make you not escape. No reason for this, shame for the design, not being able to raise the bar on riddles, 0 thought.

 I would not recommend it to anyone! If you are new, you'll need all the hints, if you are experienced it will be boring and pointless. What can I say.. Have a lot of people for searching

 Definitely don't go expecting to use your brain. 1 white puzzle, because come on, it was lame
