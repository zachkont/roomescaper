The first room is about an escape from a bunker after a nuclear disaster (duh, if you did not get that I don't know what you are doing here).

Unfortunately,  I do not have many good things to say about this room. Starting with looks. Aesthetically, even though in an easy category, a bunker is not anything complicated, it doesn't make it work. The items do not fit the place, nothing in there makes it pretty or believable as a true bunker. Something between a lack of funds and hard work.

Now, to be frank, searching is not my game style. Just like in Athens clue, there is nothing that looks like a puzzle. There are a lot of hidden clues, on every corner, that when assembeled give you a password or a key. Since there are a ton of locks to open, this happens repeatedly. Very few physical tasks, that look poorly and hastily made, at least add a bit of spice in the mix.

Just for the huge amount of locks, you need to be at least 3 if you try it. I can't think of giving it anything higher as a rating.
