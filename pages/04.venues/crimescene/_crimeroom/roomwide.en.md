The murder was commited in an old house in the suburbs of Athens and the clues lead you to a suspect. Themistoklis use many classic riddles to hide what he knew. A huge living room, one of the biggest rooms
 I have seen in an escape room, becomes your scene. OK decoration, it is plainly an old house.

One of my fastest escapes, non stop solving.
Of course experience makes things faster, although I do not think it is a tough room. The serial design of the puzzles, which are not very complex in themselves, makes things easy.
There are very few distractions in the room. Still, I would not name it a bad room, just unchallenging for people with experience. The puzzles are typical for an escape room,
few interactive/mechanical/you know elements (those that were however, are exellent, has one of my favorites) and a cute attempt to push you into the mood. While the place is spacious, most of it
is unusable, dissapoining. They do have a very elegant "do not touch" though.

Recommended for new players. Even for them, it should not be very tough. The whole game fits new players
