The puzzles start from the hallway! The Box has 4 rooms that provide different things and work on both the movie atmosphere and the riddle quality. Each with a distinguished style, with a basis of and interactive experience, beautifull work on sound, the design 
and in many stages of the game you forget that this is a game and just live the story.
Obvious good taste on all the rooms and as it expands makes both the new and the old better.

Designed by its owner, so there is nothing else like it. There is a point system, you score depending on your speed and the number of hints you'll need (and the barrel rolls you do).
