The whip is not included, you should bring your own.

So close to Indiana Jones, like no other room. The set is amazing just like every other part of the temple, exactly as you would like it. Practically, you'll be amazed by how close everything is to what you expect.
Senario, riddles and props, are 100% as you know them.

Simply, pure pleasure. For sure one of the most beautiful rooms I have played. You will be searching, but not in drawers and tables, you do that everywhere. You will solve riddles, not boring pairing clues,
here things are slightly more intresting. You will be active, no running, but it is not a room you will be solving standing in a corner.

I might have wanted it larger, since I am used to huge temples, but, it honors its name, Temple Box. The space is for at most 4 people, would not recommend any more. The riddles are all at a level that requires some thought
 and not very common "escape room" things. For a video game, maybe more common. Which means you need a somewhat strong team.

Œùote: there are 3 levels of difficulty, implemented flawlessly. Of course I prefer the hardest one, however the other ones are also great, so do not be ashamed of choosing the others, you might have a better time.

Something between 5 and 6 seems proper for a rating.
